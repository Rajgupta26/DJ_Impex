/**
 * The Fabric Journal index.
 *
 * It was deleted on 2026-09-22 when the journal moved to a section on the home
 * page, and restored on 2026-09-23 when the agency took that section back for
 * the collection. The journal is only here now, and the nav points at /journal
 * rather than /#journal.
 *
 * The newest post runs across the page; the rest sit in a grid under a rule.
 * The earlier version of this page repeated the lead post's opening paragraph as
 * a hard-coded string, truncated mid-word with an ellipsis. `PostCard` already
 * takes the excerpt from the post's own front matter, so that is gone.
 */
/**
 * Rendered per request rather than served from the CDN's cache.
 *
 * These pages show content the admin panel writes, and `revalidate` plus
 * `revalidatePath` did not make that reliable on Vercel: measured against
 * production, consecutive requests after one edit alternated between the old
 * and the new copy, because the page is cached at several edge nodes that
 * regenerate independently. A panel that reports success while the website
 * shows yesterday's text is the whole complaint, so correctness wins here.
 *
 * The cost is a server render and one store read per request. If that shows up
 * in the page timings, cache the store read on a short tag rather than putting
 * the HTML back in the edge cache.
