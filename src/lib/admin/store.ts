/**
 * Collections of JSON documents, read and written through a storage driver:
 * the local filesystem in development, Vercel Blob in production. See
 * ./storage for why there are two.
 *
 * Every mutation goes through `mutate`, which reads, transforms and writes
 * under the document's version. If another writer got there first the write is
 * refused and the whole operation is retried against the new state, rather than
 * overwriting their change. That is the part an in-process lock cannot do once
 * the host runs more than one instance.
 *
 * The in-process queue is kept as well. It costs nothing and turns the common
 * case -- one operator clicking quickly -- into an ordered queue rather than a
 * sequence of conflicts and retries.
