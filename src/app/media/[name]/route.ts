 * Serves an image uploaded through the admin panel.
 *
 * It exists because the Blob store is private: nothing in it is reachable
 * without the token, and the token stays on the server. This route is the one
 * deliberate opening, and it only ever reads a single file name under the
 * uploads prefix -- never a document, never a path with a separator in it.
 *
 * It sits outside /admin on purpose. These are website images, and the
 * next/image optimiser fetches them server-side without the browser's
 * credentials, so putting them behind the admin password would break every
 * thumbnail the moment one was set.
