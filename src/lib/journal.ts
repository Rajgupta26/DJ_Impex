/**
 * The Fabric Journal, from both of its sources.
 *
 * Posts come from two places and always will: the MDX in brand-kit/content,
 * which is the agency's copy and goes through review and version control, and
 * the admin panel, which is the client writing for themselves. Neither is
 * going to absorb the other, so this merges them.
 *
 * A panel post carries `source: "panel"` so a page can tell them apart -- the
 * MDX ones are rendered by MDXRemote, the panel ones by the safe Markdown
 * renderer, because compiling hand-typed prose as MDX throws on a stray brace.
 *
 * Only published panel posts are included. A draft is invisible to the website.
